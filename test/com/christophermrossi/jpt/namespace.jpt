      The question here is will our PageTemplate recognize,
      <span xyz:replace="here/friend/map/friend">the namespace?</span>
    </p>

    <p tal:idontknow="whocares">
      This should not <span tal:replace="'I am a pretty kitty'">do anything</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <tal:tag>Tags with namespaces will apparently <xyz:nothing>be filtered out</xyz:nothing>
               by HTML Tidy, but their contents will remain.  I'm not sure how I feel about that
               but then again it's not something that really ought to come up.  Now that we've 
               switched to nekohtml, however, it is no longer an issue.
