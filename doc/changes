 - implemented 'default' and 'nothing' variables
 - Added tal:evaluate statement.
 - Fixed bug(?) wherein variables used in a tal:repeat would clobber
   their previous values.  Now when a tal:repeat loop finishes the
   previous value of the repeat variable is restored.

New in 0.10.0
 - Integrated the BeanShell.  This allows evaluation of Java expressions 
   and calling of external BeanShell scripts.
 - Structured (xml/html) content is now handled by nekohtml rather
   than Tidy.  Introduced HTMLFragment object which might potentially
   be useful in other apps.

New in 0.9.3

 - Added real namespace support (thank you nekohtml).
 - Added support for arrays.
 - Added bool/cond to bool helper
 - Added date helper.
 - Upgraded metal code to support slots definition and filling across
   multiple layers of macro.
 - Fixed bug with evaluating arrays inside method calls.
 - Added xercesImpl to lib as it is a dependency of nekohtml.  This didn't 
   become a problem until I upgraded to ant 1.6.2.  Previous versions of ant 
   must have included xerces in the classpath.
